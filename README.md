File test.js has solutions to some Leetcode Top 150 interview tasks.

Respective functions with solutions are added individually and previous ones are commented.

To run and test the required approach:

1. Comment on all other functions
2. Open index.html in a browser
3. See the result in the console log (Dev tools)

New solutions are added from time to time.
